# 🧮 TaxCalculator-SMD  
**Fundamentals & Hardcoded Logic Based Tax Calculation System**

## 📌 Project Overview

**TaxCalculator-SMD** is a simple Java-based tax calculation application developed to practice **fundamental programming concepts** and demonstrate **hardcoded tax logic implementation**.

This project is ideal for **beginners and students** who want to understand how conditional logic, variables, calculations, and control structures work in real-world style programs.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand **core programming fundamentals**
- Implement **hardcoded tax rules**
- Practice **conditional statements & calculations**
- Build logic using **basic Java concepts**
- Strengthen **problem-solving skills**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **OOP Fundamentals**
- Console-based input/output

---

## 🧠 Core Fundamentals Covered

- Variables & Data Types  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)  
- Arithmetic Operations  
- User Input Handling  
- Method Decomposition  
- Logical Flow Control  
- Clean Code Practices  

---

## 🔒 Hardcoded Logic Explanation

This project uses **hardcoded tax slabs and rates** instead of database or API-based tax systems.

### Example:

```java
if (salary <= 50000) {
    tax = salary * 0.05;
} else if (salary <= 100000) {
    tax = salary * 0.10;
} else {
    tax = salary * 0.15;
}
```
## Why Hardcoding?

- Helps beginners understand logic clearly
- Keeps project simple & easy to follow
- No dependency on external data sources
- Ideal for academic and learning purposes

## ⚙️ Features

- Input salary amount
- Calculates tax based on predefined rules
- Displays final tax payable
- Simple & beginner-friendly flow
- Clean and readable code structure
